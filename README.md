OpenJam2018 Submission

Hello! This is a game made by me, AstroPippin, and my friend eglantine. This is the second time we've collaborated for OpenJam. Please enjoy our game!

Installation: This was made using the Godot 3 game engine. The easiest way to compile a playable game is to use Godot's export tool to compile for the platform of your choice. The controls should even work for mobile devices such as android!

Gameplay Instructions: COMING SOON
